# Linode-VM-Traffic-Checking
If you want to check individual linode traffic monthly.
Here's the example for outbound traffic data collection. Why no inbound traffic data? Because the inbound traffic for Linode VM is FREE!!!!

Please maintain the month/year data manually in the .py file, as I'm too lazy to do it.
And Please also list the linode IDs into instance_ids.txt manually, again...I'm too lazy to do it automatically.

Enjoy it!
